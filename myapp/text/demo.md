Click on the subbasins to see the demographic findings of each subbasin in the Stillaguamish River Basin. The categories refer to the following: 

**Subbasin Name** - name of the subbasin

**Total Score** - the sum of all following subscores

**POC Score** - a measure of the relative amount of people of color (POC)

**Poverty Score** - a measure of the relative amount of people living under the poverty level

**Unemployment Score** - a measure of the relative amount of unemploymed people 

**Presence of Tribal Land** - presence or absence of tribal land 

A higher total score suggests that restoration in a particular subbasin could have a greater positive impact on marginalized communities. Subscores closer to 1 indicates that most census tracts in a subbasin have a higher percentage of POC, poverty, or unemployment relative to other tracts in the Stillaguamish basin (POC) or to the Washington state averages (poverty, unemployment). Refer to the final report to see details on calculations of subscores.
