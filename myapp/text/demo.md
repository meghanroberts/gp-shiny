The map below displays the demographic score assigned to subbasins within the Stillaguamish region where restoration efforts could potentially enhance the abundance of Chinook spawners. Gray subbasins are regions in which there is no demonstrated benefit of restoration to Chinook spawners. The total score is calculated by combining factors such as the proportion of People of Color (POC), poverty levels, unemployment rates, and the presence of tribal land. A higher score suggests that restoration in a particular subbasin could have a greater positive impact on marginalized communities.
