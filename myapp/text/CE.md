The cost effectiveness for subbasin by action was calculate by using the follwoign equation: 

\[
C = \frac{a}{(1 + r)^t}
\]

Where **a** represents the annual cost, **C** is the total cost, and **r** is the discount rate of 3%. This is then divided by the total number of estimated annual Chinook spawners for the subbasin by action resulting in the cost effectiveness. 

*Note: A cost effectiveness score was not included for floodplain habitat restoration in the Mainstem as it is an unusually high outlier and makes comparisons across subbasins challenging to visualize.*
