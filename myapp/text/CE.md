Cost effectiveness values were calculated for each subbasin by applicable restoration actions. The annual project costs were discounted at a rate of 3% (which is used by NOAA on restoration projects) and divided by the annual increase in Chinook spawners. The cost effectiveness can be seen as the annual dollar per increased spawner. However, these estimates do not incorporate the additional spawners that would result from the estimated increase in annual spawners. Therefore, these cost estimates strongly underestimate the actual cost per spawner and should be used more as a gauge of which actions are more cost effective rather than an absolute estimate.

*Note: A cost effectiveness score was not included for floodplain habitat restoration in the Mainstem as it is an unusually high outlier and makes comparisons across subbasins challenging to visualize.*
