Benefits presented here represent the additional number of spawning adults each subbasin could support if the habitat were restored to historical conditions (pre-1900s). Since Chinook are the foucs of this study, we only present increased spawner abundance in subbasins where restoration would benefit Chinook salmon. Additionally, we show the increase in spawning adults of coho and steelhead that would result from actions directed at Chinook recovery. These values were derived from the [HARP model](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/48860) results.
