Low and high cost per unit (acre, mile or stucture) and total cost (entire subbasin restored) estimates were calculated for each of the three actions in subbasins with estimated increase in Chinook spawners. Cost estimates were made using the *A Primer on Habitat Project Costs* and corrected for inflation using the Producer Price Index (PSSS, 2003). The cost estimates include construction, design, permitting, appraisal, basic monitoring (2 years), routine maintenance (2 years), reestablishing the site to prior conditions, and project management costs that are normally associated with implementing a capital project. *Refer to the final report for specific cost estimate calculations.*<br><br>
