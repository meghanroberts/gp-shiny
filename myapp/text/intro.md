[Puget Sound Chinook](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/endangered-species-conservation/puget-sound-chinook-salmon) were classified as Threatened in 1999 under the Endangered Species Act. Since then, conservationists have been addressing threats such as habitat degradation and overfishing. Within the Puget Sound Chinook Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU), there are 22 populations. The **Stillaguamish River Chinook** stand out because their recovery progress is slower compared to other ESU populations. Our study examined various habitat restoration actions aimed at boosting Chinook populations in the Stillaguamish, helping restoration managers make informed decisions about where to focus efforts. Specifically, we focused on floodplain restoration, engineered log jams and riparian planting. These restoration actions not only benefit Chinook but also other salmonid species like coho (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*) and steelhead (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*). Furthermore, increasing Chinook populations would provide more prey for endangered [Southern Resident Killer Whales](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/endangered-species-conservation/southern-resident-killer-whale-orcinus-orca) and support fisheries.
