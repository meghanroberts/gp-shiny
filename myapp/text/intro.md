The [Fish Creek Watershed Observatory (FCWO)](http://www.fishcreekwatershed.org/) is a focal watershed within the [National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPR-A)](https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/about/alaska/NPR-A). Targeted lake and stream monitoring within the watershed provide site-specific data prior to and after the establishment of new petroleum development, as well as insight into dynamics related to climate change and variability. Eleven lakes of interest (Harry Potter, Hipbone, Iceshove, L9817, L9819, L9820, Little Alaska, Lower Snowman, M9925, Middle Snowman, and Serenity) are featured in this dashboard.

[Puget Sound Chinook](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/endangered-species-conservation/puget-sound-chinook-salmon) were classified as Threatened in 1999 under the Endangered Species Act. Since then, conservationists have been addressing threats such as habitat degradation and overfishing. Within the Puget Sound Chinook Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU), there are 22 populations. The **Stillaguamish River Chinook** stand out because their recovery progress is slower compared to other ESU populations. Our study examined various habitat restoration actions aimed at boosting Chinook populations in the Stillaguamish, helping restoration managers make informed decisions about where to focus efforts. Specifically, we focused on riparian planting, engineered log jams and floodplain restoration. These restoration actions not only benefit Chinook but also other salmonid species like coho (*Oncorhynchus kisutch*) and steelhead (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*). Furthermore, increasing Chinook populations would provide more prey for endangered [Southern Resident Killer Whales](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/endangered-species-conservation/southern-resident-killer-whale-orcinus-orca) and support fisheries.

This application was produced as a part of a [master's group project](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects/prioritizing-chinook-salmon-habitat-restoration-southern-resident-killer-whale-recovery) completed by Ray Hunter, Lars Nelson, Meghan Roberts and Logan Ruggles for the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/). The client for this project was the [National Marine Fisheries Service](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/), otherwise known as NOAA Fisheries.
